# TODO
Things I want to configure in nvim

* ~~don't wrap text, allow scrolling (but wrap errors, because for whatever reason we can't scroll to see those)~~
* get AI chat window
* ~~get copilot working~~
* open file at line when init error
* ~~fix the android esc = ` and possibly disable del~~
* show definitions of things on hover (i.e variable type)
* auto import go - kind of works with code action, but should just happen automatically by running that on save
* when focusing terminal go directly to terminal mode
* easily open more than 1 terminal
* ~~move windows while in insert mode~~
* ~~automatic close of ({["'~~
